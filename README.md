# 🦖 Jumping Dinosaur Game

A simple, fun, and addictive 2D game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** where you control a dinosaur that jumps over incoming cactuses. Inspired by the classic Chrome offline game — but with custom styling, sound effects, a distance meter, and restart/play functionality.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Click** or press the **Spacebar** to make the dinosaur jump.
- Avoid colliding with the cactuses.
- The game gets harder as the cactuses appear continuously.
- Your **distance in meters** is tracked while you're alive.
- When the dinosaur hits a cactus → **Game Over**.
- Press **Restart** to try again.
